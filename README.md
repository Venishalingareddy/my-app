Project Overview:
This project is a web application built using React that facilitates the comparison of performance between two different databases. Users can input SQL queries and observe the execution time as well as the results for each database. The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for database performance evaluation.

Key Points:

1.Two Panels for Database Comparison:
#The application consists of two panels, each representing a different database.
#Panel 1: TPC-H Database 1 with a size of 1 GB.
#Panel 2: TPC-H Database 2 with a size of 10 MB.

2.Input SQL Queries:
#Within each panel, users have access to a textbox where they can input their SQL queries.
#This allows users to specify the queries they want to run against the respective databases.

3.Submit Button for Query Execution:
#After inputting the SQL query, users can click the submit button within each panel to execute the query against the respective database.
#Upon clicking the submit button, the application initiates the query execution process.

4.Processing Time Display:
#Once the query execution is complete, the application displays the processing time taken by each database to execute the query.

5.Show Result Button:
#Below the processing time display, there is a "Show Result" button available for each panel.
#Users can click this button to view the results of the executed query for the respective database.

6.Interactive User Experience:
#The application offers an interactive user experience, allowing users to input queries, execute them, and view results seamlessly.
#Users can compare the performance metrics of both databases side by side.

How to Use:

1.Installation:
#Clone the repository to your local machine.
#Install the necessary dependencies using npm.

2.Running the Application:
#Start the development server to run the application locally.

3.Interacting with the Application:
#Input SQL queries into the textboxes provided in each panel.
#Click the submit button to execute the queries against the respective databases.
#View the processing time displayed for each database.
#Click the "Show Result" button to view the results of the executed queries.
